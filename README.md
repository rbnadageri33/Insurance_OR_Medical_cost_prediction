# Insurance_OR_Medical_cost_prediction

# Dataset Information
The dataset used in this project provides information about health insurance beneficiaries and their medical costs. It includes the following columns:
Variable	Description

age	age of primary beneficiary

bmi	body mass index

children	number of children covered by health insurance

smoker	smoking

region	the beneficiary's residential area in the US

charges	individual medical costs billed by health insurance


# Approach
The project will involve several steps, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation. The dataset will be prepared by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. Various regression algorithms, such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting, will be explored and evaluated to determine the most effective model for cost prediction.

# Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the medical costs for individuals based on their attributes. By analyzing the dataset and identifying patterns and relationships, the model will provide insights into the factors influencing medical expenses.
